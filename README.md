# MultiplatformParcelize
This repo contains a proof-of-concept for using @Parcelize in Kotlin
Multiplatform projects.

It is _not_ designed to be imported as a dependency into other projects.
Instead, it just serves as a (hopefully useful) guide on how to use `expect`
and `actual` declarations for Interfaces and Annotation Classes.
